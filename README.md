This illustrates Delay-and-Sum and classical Minimum Variance beamforming methods in ultrasound imaging.<br>
The raw data was generated using script_1_make_simulation.m Matlab script.<br>
Delay-and-Sum beamforming is performed in script_2_DAS.m <br>
Minimum Variance beamforming is performed in script_2_MVDR.m <br>
The probe characteristics are defined in probeUS.mat inside the folder probe_data.
