This illustrates Delay-and-Sum and classical Minimum Variance beamforming methods in ultrasound imaging.
The raw data was generated using script_1_make_simulation.m Matlab script.
Delay-and-Sum beamforming is performed in script_2_DAS.m
Minimum Variance beamforming is performed in script_2_MVDR.m
The probe characteristics are defined in probeUS.mat inside the folder probe_data.
